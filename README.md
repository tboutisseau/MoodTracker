# Moodtracker
Moodtracker is a simple app that lets users record their daily mood. They can add a comment to
explain the reason of their mood.

They can then view their moods for the past week in a history list, providing a clear vision of their mood trends. Any comment left can be displayed in a toast message. The history can also be viewed in form of a pie chart.
